# Chat App Server

This is the **server-side** component of the chat application, built using **Dart**. It handles requests, authentication, real-time messaging, and stores messages using SQLite. The server works in conjunction with the Flutter-based client-side app, which you can find [here](https://github.com/natnael-kiros/chat-app).

## Features

- **Authentication:** Handles user authentication (sign up and log in).
- **Real-Time Chat:** Supports instant messaging between users and group chats.
- **Message Storage:** Messages are stored in an SQLite database with timestamps.
- **Broadcast Messages:** Enables one-way communication for updates.
- **Group Chats:** Manages group creation and messaging.
